# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to help Tom and Seth in submitting the election audit results to the election commission. We used Python and VS Code to help us find the election results as well as the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county and the county with the highest turnouts.

## Election-Audit Summary:
This script is a powerfull aid for the election committee. It will significantly speed up the election verification process and can be used for a handfull of other scenarios. For example, with a more detailed csv file, we could modify the script to account for gender or even neighborhood. Python is powerful enough to allow us to handle far more data points and we could even modify the script to account for smaller details like which sex is voting for which candidate. This information could be viable for future elections and future candidates looking to run in the certain area. With larger data files, we could even expand the script to run in the entire state and even the full country.
